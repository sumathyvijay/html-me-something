        <h1>Welcome to my first webpage.This is about my trip to India. </h1>
        <h2>Over the summer , my family and I went to India. We visited a city called Madurai,Chennai & Delhi.</h2>
            <h3>Madurai</h3>
            <p>
                Madurai is southern part of India.Meenakshi Amman temple is famous in Madurai.The temple is in the center of 2,500-year-old city of Madurai and is a significant symbol for the Tamil people. Though most of the present structure was built between 1623 and 1655 CE. It is said that the temple was originally built in the 6th century BC by survivors of the Kumari Kandam. In the 14th century, the Sultanate Muslim Commander Malik Kafur plundered the temple and looted it of its valuables. It was rebuilt by the Nayak ruler Vishwanatha Nayakar around the 16th century. It houses 14 gopurams (gateway towers), ranging from 45â€“50m in height. The tallest is the southern tower, 51.9 metres (170 ft) high,and two golden sculptured vimanas, the shrines over the garbhagrihas (sanctums) of the main deities.We took part in a ceremony which involved prayer to the Hindu gods and goddesses.

            <h3>Chennai</h3>

            <p>
                Next i visit to chennai.Chennai (formerly known as Madras) is the capital city of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It has a population of about 7 million people. Almost 10% of all of the people in the state live in Chennai. The city is the fourth largest city of India. It was founded in 1661 by the British East India Company. The city is on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal.Chennai is the automobile capital of India. It is also referred as the Detroit of South Asia. The 12 km (7 mi) long Marina Beach in Chennai, is one of the longest beaches in the world. The city is separated into three parts by two rivers. The Cooum River divides the city into almost half and the Adyar River divides the southern half of the city into two parts. The historic Buckingham Canal runs through the city. It is almost parallel to the coast. The 350 year old city still has much of its old charm. Today, it is a big commercial and industrial centre. The city has much cultural heritage. The temples, shrines, forts and palaces of the city combine its past with the present.

            <h3>Delhi</h3>
           
            <p>
                I also visited Delhi.Delhi is the traditional and present day capital of India. It is the third largest city of the world. It is also the second largest metropolis after Mumbai with a population of over 13 million. Delhi is also one of the oldest continually inhabited cities of India.Delhi stands in a triangle formed by the Yamuna river in the east and spurs from the Aravalli range in the west and south. It is surrounded by Haryana on all sides except east where it borders with Uttar Pradesh, Delhi has a semi-arid climate with high variation between summer and winter temperature.As evidenced by archaeological relics, human inhabitation was probably present in and around Delhi during the second millennium B.C. This city is believed to be the site of Indraprastha, legendary capital of the Pandavas in the Indian epic, the Mahabharata. It has been ruled by many dynasties Prithvi Raj Chauhan was one of the last Rajput rulers of Delhi.
